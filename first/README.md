Boilerplate echo using JMS (ActiveMQ) on the Kaazing Gateway 4.0.4 (with demos).  Increments a counter.  Sends the current value to the server.  Displays it to the user when the message comes back (arrives).  Uses a little GreenSock Animation Platform and CSS Transforms to spice things up a little.
