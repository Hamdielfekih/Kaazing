PaaS (Platform as a Service)
=======

While Kaazing Gateway is generally an on-premisis solution, various additional options have been explored.  For example, Kaazing Gateway is available on the Amazon Marketplace, quickly allowing customers to run their own instance in the cloud.  A Docker option is also available.

One option we wanted to explore was a platform as a service option for Kaazing Gateway.  We effectively wanted to run Gatewa in a Kaazing-controlled cloud, and then allow customers to use that cloud directly through authorization keys, tokens, or other means of securing their access (and giving the PaaS the ability to track usage).

This is an early prototype developed to set the vision for what a PaaS might look like, and how it might operate.  The project allowed us to find the use-cases that presented the most challenge.  These challenges could be product-oriented, or skill-oriented.  After several rounds of presenting the concept to management, the PaaS option was never funded, and never moved forward.
